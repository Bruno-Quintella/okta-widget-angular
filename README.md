## Running the Sample with your Okta Organization
###Pre-requisites
This sample application was tested with an Okta organization. If you do not have an Okta organization, you can easily [sign up for a free Developer Okta org](https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/).

1. Verify OpenID Connect is enabled for your Okta organization. `Admin -> Applications -> Add Application -> Create New App -> OpenID Connect`
  - If you do not see this option, email [developers@okta.com](mailto:developers@okta.com) to enable it.
2. In the **Create A New Application Integration** screen, click the **Platform** dropdown and select **Single Page App (SPA)**
3. Press **Create**. When the page appears, enter an **Application Name**. Press **Next**.
4. Add **http://localhost:8080** to the list of *Redirect URIs*
5. Click **Finish** to redirect back to the *General Settings* of your application.
6. Copy the **Client ID**, as it will be needed for the Okta AuthSDK client configuration.
7. Enable [CORS access](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/enabling_cors.html) to your Okta organization
8. Finally, select the **People** tab and **Assign to People** in your organization.

## Build Instructions
